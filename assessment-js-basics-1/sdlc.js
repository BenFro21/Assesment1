// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analysisRequirements = 'Developers will look into what framworks and technoligies are required'
let design = ' the layout of the feature, how it will flow, if it needs a button or not etc'
let implementation = 'codeing bringing the first 3 steps to action'
let testingIntegration = 'Making sure the product is working and eliminateing bugs. Intergrateing is mergeing into exsisting files and deployment'
let maintain = 'Handle user bugs and launch bugs they were not found in the testing phase, look into if the whole proccess should be started again for a diffrent feature'
